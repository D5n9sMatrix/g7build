The Dot Product
Definition 2.5 is not always the easiest way to compute a matrix-vector product Ax because it requires
that the columns of A be explicitly identified. There is another way to find such a product which uses the
matrix A as a whole with no reference to its columns, and hence is useful in practice. The method depends
on the following notion.
Definition 2.6 Dot Product in Rn
If (a1 , a2 , . . . , an ) and (b1 , b2 , . . . , bn ) are two ordered n-tuples, their dot product is defined to
be the number
a1 b1 + a2 b2 + · · · + an bn
obtained by multiplying corresponding entries and adding the results.
